## Liberty  Bank Loan

Liberty Bank is a reputable financial institution that empowers individuals and businesses through innovative banking solutions. With a focus on customer service and community growth, it offers a variety of loans, accounts, and investment options. The bank emphasizes financial inclusion and responsible lending to ensure the well-being of its clients and foster economic stability.


## Business Tasks

To effectively monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we must create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report will provide critical insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time, supporting data-driven decisions, tracking the health of our loan portfolio, and identifying trends to inform our lending strategies.


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

1. Total Loan Applications: Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

2. Total Funded Amount: Determine the total funds disbursed as loans. Monitor the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyze MoM changes in this metric.

3. Total Amount Received: Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess cash flow and loan repayment. Analyze the MTD Total Amount Received and observe MoM changes.

4. Average Interest Rate: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans. Monitor the MTD average interest rate and track MoM variations to gain insights into the overall cost of our lending portfolio.

5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate our borrowers' average DTI to gauge their financial health. Compute the MTD average DTI and track MoM fluctuations.

This structured report will equip us with the information to ensure our lending practices are effective and sustainable.

## Data Source

Financial Loan data: The primary data used for this analysis "Financial_loan.csv" file, contains detailed information about each sale made by the company

- Analyzing Loan Applications: Assess trends of the loan applications and  their patterns  over time.

- Tracking Funded Amounts of the Borrowers: Evaluate the trends in the total funded amount and analyze Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

- Monitoring Amounts Received from the Borrowers: Track the total amount received from borrowers and assess cash flow patterns For the bank.

- Calculating Average Interest Rates: Determine average interest rates across all loans From the bank, Month-to-date (MTD), and Month-over-month (MoM) variations.

- Evaluating Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Compute the average DTI for borrowers, Month-to-date (MTD), and Month-over-month (MoM) fluctuations to gauge the financial health of the borrowers.

- Advanced SQL Techniques: Utilize a range of SQL techniques including:

    - Basic SQL Queries for foundational analysis.

    - Sub Queries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to solve complex problems.

    - SQL Aggregate Functions to compute summary statistics.

    - SQL Window Functions for advanced calculations.

- Data Visualization with Power BI: Create intuitive visualizations and dashboards to represent findings and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

The primary purpose for loan collection is debt consolidation, which accounts for the highest number of loan applicants at 18,214. The total money loaned for this purpose stands at 232,459,675, with a total of 253,801,871 received. The second most common loan purpose is credit card refinancing, with 4,998 applicants, 58,885,175 in total money loaned, and 65,214,084 in total money received. In contrast, renewable energy is the least common loan purpose, with only 94 applicants, 845,750 in total money loaned, and 898,931 in total money received.

## Recommendations


Given the data, here are some recommendations for Liberty Bank to improve its loan portfolio management:

1. Enhance Risk Assessment: Given the high average interest rates and debt-to-income ratios in bad loans, strengthening the risk assessment process could help in identifying potential defaults earlier.

2. Adjust Lending Criteria: Reevaluate and possibly tighten lending criteria for high-risk applicants to reduce the number of non-performing loans.

3. Focus on Debt Consolidation: Since debt consolidation is the most common loan purpose, consider offering more tailored and competitive products in this category to attract quality borrowers.

4. Regional Strategies: With California and New York leading in both loan applications and total money, it's clear these regions are crucial. Implement specific marketing and risk management strategies for these high-performing states.

5. Promote Renewable Energy Loans: Given that renewable energy loans are the least common, creating incentives or awareness campaigns could boost this segment and diversify the loan portfolio.

6. Optimize Loan Terms: Analyze the performance of the different loan terms (36 months vs. 60 months) to understand borrower preferences and risk profiles better. This could help in designing more attractive loan products.

7. Improve Recovery Strategies: Given the disparity between total money loaned and received in bad loans, enhance strategies for recovering bad debt to mitigate losses.

8. By implementing these strategies, Liberty Bank can not only minimize risks but also maximize opportunities within its loan portfolio


## Limitations

A few limitations to consider:

1. Data Quality: Inconsistent or inaccurate data can skew analysis, leading to misguided decisions. Ensuring data integrity is crucial.

2. Economic Factors: External economic conditions can impact loan performance, making it harder to predict and manage risk accurately.

3. Regulatory Changes: Changes in banking regulations or policies can affect loan practices and require adjustments to strategies.

4. Borrower Behavior: Unpredictable changes in borrower behavior can impact loan repayment, complicating risk assessment and mitigation efforts.

5. Technological Limitations: Reliance on technology for data analysis and risk assessment can be limited by the accuracy and capabilities of the tools and systems used.

By recognizing these limitations, Liberty Bank can take proactive measures to mitigate risks and improve its loan portfolio management.
